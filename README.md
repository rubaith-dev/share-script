This is a web application where users can quickly share their files with different other users without going through any kind of authentication. There are lots of other file sharing system even embedded in a small chat application. But those file sharing has some sort of upload limitations. Trying to resolve those issue.


## Features

- To create an application where user will be able to upload big files/folders. No file size limitations.
- A quick share link will be created to share the link with the other users.
- User can decide the time to expire the link.
- When the link is expired the file should be deleted automatically from the cloud storage.
- User can put password lock for the file to be opened by the intended users only. If the public link exposed, still you require password to access the file.

- User should be able to delete the file anytime before the expiration of the link.
